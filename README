This project is an interactive simulation of firefighting robots designed to extinguish fires on a map composed of various terrain types. The application is developed in Java and features a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the map, the fires, and the movement of the robots.

The robots follow an optimized strategy to efficiently navigate the terrain and extinguish the fires.
